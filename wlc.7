NAME

    wlc - wayland compositor library

DESCRIPTION

    wlc is a library created to make writing wayland compositors much easier
    by providing most of the necessary interface to the wayland protocol.

    General concepts

        Views

            Surfaces with interactive roles which handling is left to user of
            wlc library (usually windows, handled by window manager).

        Protocol extensions

            xdg-surface

                Provides surface role for traditional desktop like behaviour.
                The extension is still in development, but preferred and is the
                one that will be used by major DEs (GNOME, KDE, E*).

            shell-surface

                Deprecated surface role built into libwayland.
                It's not suitable for desktops and is currently only used by
                legacy programs and by Qt.

        Surfaces

            Rectangular area that is displayed on the screen. It has a
            location, size and pixel contents.  wlc's views are surfaces that
            have interactive role assigned.

        Outputs

            Target which containing surfaces are composed to.
