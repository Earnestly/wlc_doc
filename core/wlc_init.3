WLC_INIT(3)                                              WLC CORE API FUNCTIONS

NAME

    wlc_init - initialize the wlc library

SYNOPSIS

    bool wlc_init(const struct wlc_interface *interface, int argc, char *argv[]);
     
DESCRIPTION

    wlc_init() initializes the wlc library.  Additionally the argc and
    argv from main() may be passed to facilitate renaming the child process it
    spawns on wlc_init to "wlc".

    The interface provides the necessary hooks into the compositor via the
    wlc_interface structure. 

RETURN VALUE

    wlc_init() will return true if initialization was successful.

ERRORS

    wlc_init() will exit with failure if argv is NULL but argc is greater than
    zero or if the interface is not defined.

NOTES

    wlc_init() may be called only once during the program's lifetime.

EXAMPLE

    #include <stdlib.h>
    #include <wlc/wlc.h>
    
    int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
        static struct wlc_interface dummy;
        wlc_init(&dummy, argc, argv);

        exit(EXIT_SUCCESS);
    }
