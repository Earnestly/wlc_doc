NAME

    wlc_view_get_app_id - get the application identifier for a given view

SYNOPSIS

    const char* wlc_view_get_app_id(wlc_handle view);

    Wayland protocol requirements:
        wlc_view_get_app_id(): xdg_shell

DESCRIPTION

    wlc_view_get_app_id() can be used to acquire application identifier which
    identifies the general class of applications to which the view belongs.
    The compositor can use this to group multiple views together, or to
    determine how to launch a new application.

    For applications supporting D-Bus activation the application identifier is
    used as the D-Bus service name.

RETURN VALUE

    wlc_view_get_app_id() returns the application identifier for view if the
    assigned role for view is xdg-surface.  

    If the role is not xdg-surface then wlc_view_get_app_id() will return NULL.
